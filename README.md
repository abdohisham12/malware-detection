Malware Detection Project üõ°Ô∏è
Overview
Predicting Windows machine's probability of getting infected by various malware families based on machine properties. Utilizing a stacked model approach combining multiple machine learning algorithms to improve detection accuracy.

Key Features
Stacked Model: Combines Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM for diversity, outlier handling, and speed.
Dataset: Telemetry data from Windows Defender, including machine configurations, OS details, and antivirus product states.
Evaluation Metric: ROC-AUC for imbalanced datasets.
