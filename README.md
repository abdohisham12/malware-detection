# üõ°Ô∏è Malware Detection Project

## Overview
The Malware Detection Project aims to predict the likelihood of a Windows machine getting infected by various families of malware. Using telemetry data from Windows Defender, which includes machine configurations, operating system details, and antivirus product states, the project utilizes a stacked model approach to enhance detection accuracy.

### Stacked Model Approach
The project combines the following machine learning models:
- **Random Forest**: Aggregates predictions from multiple decision trees for improved accuracy and reduced overfitting.
- **XGBoost**: Employs gradient boosting to handle outliers and large datasets efficiently.
- **LightGBM**: Known for its speed and efficiency, using leaf-wise tree growth to improve performance on large-scale data.

## Model Details
The project uses a stacked model approach with the following components:

Random Forest: Provides diversity in predictions by aggregating multiple decision trees.   
XGBoost: Improves performance on large datasets and handles outliers effectively.   
LightGBM: Offers high speed and efficient handling of large-scale data through leaf-wise growth.   
Evaluation Metric
ROC-AUC is used as the evaluation metric to assess model performance, particularly suitable for imbalanced datasets.
