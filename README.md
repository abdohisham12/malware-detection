# üõ°Ô∏è Malware Detection Project

## Overview
The goal of this project is to predict a Windows machine‚Äôs probability of getting infected by various families of malware, based on different properties of that machine. The dataset contains telemetry data collected from Windows Defender, including machine configurations, operating system details, and antivirus product states. By using a stacked model approach combining multiple machine learning algorithms, we aim to improve detection accuracy and handle various challenges posed by malware detection in a real-world setting.

The stacked model utilizes **Random Forest** for diversity in decision-making, **XGBoost** for its ability to handle outliers, and **LightGBM** for its speed and ability to handle large-scale data effectively.

Model Details
This project employs a stacked model approach to improve malware detection accuracy. The following machine learning models are used:

Random Forest: Provides diversity in decision-making by building multiple trees and aggregating their outcomes.
XGBoost: Robust against outliers and efficient for training on large datasets, making it suitable for this problem.
LightGBM: Known for its high speed and ability to handle large-scale datasets efficiently. Its leaf-wise tree growth ensures faster convergence and better performance in terms of speed and memory.
Evaluation Metric: The competition uses ROC-AUC as the evaluation metric, which is ideal for imbalanced datasets like this one.
